## Online usage (recommended)

Repetition questions for the psy300 Statistical Learning lecture of the Data Science and Machine Learning Master's course at the University of Oldenburg. The content should primarily be accessed from the online book: [![Jupyter Book Badge](https://jupyterbook.org/badge.svg)](https://janaja92.github.io/psy300_tut/)

## Credits 

This book was forked from [Micha Burkhardt](https://github.com/mibur1)'s [Jupyter book](https://github.com/mibur1/psy300). While the structure and format are based on his work, the content has been replaced with repetition quizzez for the corresponding lecture. Some of the the repetition questions included here were inspired by or adapted from materials created by [Tim Dreßler](https://github.com/timdressler). Many thanks to both of them for their contributions and inspiration! <br>
Finally, the questions in this book are primarily based on the lecture slides developed by [Prof. Dr. Andrea Hildebrandt](https://github.com/AnHild) for the psy300 module, which served as the main guide for creating this book.
