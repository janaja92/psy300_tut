# Statistical Learning with Python

**NOTE: WORK IN PROGRESS**

## Online usage (recommended)

Course materials for the psy112 seminar of the Neurocognitive Psychology Master's course at the University of Oldenburg. The content should primarily be accessed from the online book: [![Jupyter Book Badge](https://jupyterbook.org/badge.svg)](https://mibur1.github.io/psy112/)

## Local usage

Running the book locally requires to first build the book from source:

```python
cd <path/to/book/>
pip install -r requirements.txt
jb build .
```

This will create the html files in the `_build/` folder. The book can then be used by opening the `_build/html/index.html` file in a browser. The *.ipynb* notebooks for the exercises are located in the `book/` folder and can can either be opened locally or through Google Colab.
