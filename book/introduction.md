- Self-Assessment: Use these questions as a knowledge check after each lecture or when preparing for the final exam.
- Active Recall: Focus on recalling the answers without immediately checking your notes. This process significantly improves memory retention!

‚ùó Important Note: These questions represent a selection of material for study guidance and do not necessarily cover the entirety of the lecture content. This page should be used for learning and revision purposes alone and not as a substitute for the primary course materials (lecture slides, textbook readings, seminar contents, etc.). Always refer to the full module materials for comprehensive preparation.
