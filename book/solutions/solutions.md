# Exercise solutions

In this section, you'll find the solutions to the exercises. Remember, the best way to learn programming is by doing. Resist the temptation to check the answers too soon and spend time working through the problems yourself. Also, do not be discouraged if things don't work out the first time, because this is where the real learning happens.
